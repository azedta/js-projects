        "Good evening! You’ve made it through the day, and that’s already a win.
        Whatever went well, celebrate it. Whatever didn’t, learn from it and
        leave it here. The night is your reminder that rest is a form of
        progress too. Recharge, because tomorrow you’ll rise even stronger."

        there’s always light. As you close your eyes, let go of the weight you
        don’t need to carry. Trust yourself, trust the process, and let your
        dreams plant the seeds for a brighter tomorrow."
