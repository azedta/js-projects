# 🧩 JavaScript Projects Collection
### Interactive Games, UI Experiments & Application Logic (Vanilla JS)

A curated collection of **JavaScript projects** built with **vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS**, focusing on **core language fundamentals**, **DOM manipulation**, and **interactive application logic**.

This repository showcases my progression from basic game mechanics to more **application-style state management and UI rendering**, without relying on frameworks.

## 🎮 1. Pig Dice Game

A two-player dice game based on the classic **Pig Game** rules.

### Demonstrates:
- Random number generation
- Game state management (current vs total score)
- Turn switching logic
- DOM updates based on game state
- Reset / new game functionality

📌 *Focus: conditional logic, state transitions, and event handling.*

## 💬 2. Motivation Dose

A lightweight motivation / quote generator that displays a random message on user interaction.

### Demonstrates:
- DOM selection & manipulation
- Event listeners
- Array-based content storage
- Randomized output
- Clean UI updates

📌 *Focus: user interaction + dynamic content rendering.*

## 🎯 3. Guess My Number

A number-guessing game where the player tries to guess a hidden number within a range.

### Demonstrates:
- Random value generation
- Input validation
- Score tracking
- Conditional feedback (too high / too low / correct)
- Game reset logic

📌 *Focus: feedback loops and game logic.*

## 🏦 4. Bankist UI

A **banking-style user interface simulation** focusing on data-driven rendering.

### Demonstrates:
- Advanced array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Derived data calculation
- Conditional UI rendering
- Login simulation
- Sorting and balance calculations

📌 *Focus: transforming data into UI — a major step toward real applications.*

## 🏦 5. Bankist App

An extended, more complete version of the Bankist concept with deeper logic and interactions.

### Demonstrates:
- Application-level state management
- Multiple account handling
- Transaction history rendering
- Derived metrics (balance, income, expenses)
- Timers / session behavior (where applicable)

📌 *Focus: app-like logic and structured JavaScript code.*

## 📚 Course Attribution

These projects were developed as part of the course:

**“The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!”**  
by *Jonas Schmedtmann*

All implementations were written independently and iteratively refined, with additional structure and cleanup applied to reinforce **real-world JavaScript practices** beyond the course exercises.
